# Toxic-comments-classification-using-NLP 

Social media is a place where a lot of discussions happen, being anonymous 
while doing so has given the freedom to many people to express their opinions freely. 
but people who disagree with a point of view extremely can misuse this freedom 
sometimes. Sharing things that you care about will become a difficult task with this 
constant threat of harassment or toxic coments online. 

Toxic comment classification-  The dataset has 312735 comments. Out of these the training set has 1,59,571 comments while the training set has 1,53,164 comments. These comments are classified into 6 toxic behaviours. The classes are “Toxic, Severe toxic, Obscene, Threat, Insult, Identity hate”. 
 
Results : I've used 2 classification algorithm- Multinomial Naive Bayes model with 54.003% and Logistic regression with 96% accuracy.
We use the  logistic regression model because of the better performance metric.
